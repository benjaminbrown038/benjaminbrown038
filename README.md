### Hi there, my name is Benjamin Brown! ðŸ‘‹


I got started in programming during an undergraduate course called "Computing for Engineers" while getting my bachelors in Mechanical Engineering. I started with playing around on the terminal, then to object oriented program from Youtube tutorials, then to getting familar with machine learning libraries by reading articles. Finally, I got in touch with a mentor on Sharpestminds and he recommend me following Deep Learning for Coders by Jeremy Howard and Sylvain Gugger along with CNN tutorials online.

I do have some technical knowledge about machine learning through my Calculus courses taken during undergrad as well as meeting with a Mathematics professor once a week where our focus was in Artificial Neural Networks in R where we discussed the Math in the artificial architecture behind neural networks.
